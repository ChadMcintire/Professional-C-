Q. What is the difference between private and protected.
   Derived classes have access to protected methods.

Q. What does final do for a class?
   It it is a keyword theat means trying to inherit from it will result in
   a compilation error.

Q. What does override do, and when should you use it?
   Makes it so that if you are suppose to be overriding a method from a base
   class, it is required.

Q. What happens when you override a non-virtual function?
   Attempting to override a non-virtual method hides the base class definition,
   and it will only be used in the context of the derived class.

Q. When should you make methods virtual.
   Always make methods virtual unless you can't take the look up hit for the
   virtual table. This should always be done for a destructor unless the class
   is final.

Q. When does slicing not occur for a class with a base class.
   Slicing does not occur if a derived class is assigned to a pointer or
   reference to its base class.

Q. How does C++ using compile-time type of expression to bind default arguments
   not the run-time type effect default arguments?
   Default arguments are not "inherited" in C++.
